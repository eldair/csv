# SECURITY POLICY

When a new **minor** version (`9.8.x`) is released, the previous one will continue to receive security fixes for _3 more months_.

When a new **major** version is released (`6.0`, `7.0`, etc), the previous stable release remains supported for _6 more months_ through patches and security fixes.

(This policy may change in the future and exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis.)
